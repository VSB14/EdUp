## Introduction

EdUp is designed to offer an interactive, accessible learning journey. Students can engage with quality courses and instructors can share their expertise, building a global community of learners. This document outlines the technical specifications of EdUp, including its components, API structure, and setup instructions.

## Platform Structure

EdUp is organized into three main layers: front end, back end, and database. Each part plays a specific role in delivering a smooth user experience and powerful functionality.

### Client Side

The front end is powered by ReactJS, providing an interactive, responsive interface for users. Through RESTful APIs, the client communicates seamlessly with the back end to handle tasks such as user data display and course interactions.

#### Key Pages for Students:

- **Home**: Introduction to the platform, featuring key courses and personal user information.
- **Course Catalog**: Displays available courses, with details on content, ratings, and more.
- **Wishlist**: A list of courses saved for future reference.
- **Cart and Checkout**: Facilitates the purchase of selected courses.
- **Course Material**: Displays content like videos and documents for each course.
- **Profile**: Shows and allows editing of user information.

#### Key Pages for Instructors:

- **Dashboard**: Offers insights into course engagement, feedback, and performance.
- **Analytics**: Provides data on views, interactions, and other metrics.
- **Course Management**: Tools to create, edit, and organize courses.
- **Profile Settings**: Allows instructors to update account information.

#### Client-side Libraries and Tools

- **ReactJS**: Framework for building UI components.
- **CSS & Tailwind**: For consistent, responsive styling.
- **Redux**: Manages global application state for improved performance and usability.

### Server Side

The back end, built with Node.js and Express, provides a robust API structure for data management, supporting functionalities like user authentication, course management, and secure payments.

#### Back-end Functionalities

- **Authentication**: Provides secure user login and signup, including OTP and password reset options.
- **Course Creation**: Instructors can manage course details, while students can rate and review.
- **Payment Processing**: Razorpay integration supports secure payments for course purchases.
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary is used for storing images, videos, and other content.
- **Markdown Support**: Enables rich text formatting for course content.

#### Server-side Technologies

- **Node.js**: Core framework for server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: Provides a structured approach to routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: Database for flexible, scalable data storage.
- **JWT & Bcrypt**: Ensure secure user authentication and data protection.

### Database

MongoDB is utilized for data management, storing information such as user profiles, courses, and ratings. Its schema flexibility supports the platformâ€™s needs for handling various types of content.

## API Specifications

The platformâ€™s API is RESTful, built with Node.js and Express, and utilizes JSON for data exchange. Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) facilitate operations across users, courses, and other platform entities.



## Setup Guide

To run EdUp locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   cd EdUp
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Set up a MongoDB database and acquire the connection URL.
2. In the root directory, create a `.env` file with these variables:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-url>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret-key>
   ```

## How to Use

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open a new terminal for the client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
